 How Js refer HTML elements ?
-via DOM hierarchy[this is good not not used now-a-days becuase whenever the dom elements position are change then its dom upadte are needed to update .it is fast but not prefer]

you can refer by using "ID"
  document.getElementById()

id had conflict with css reference
id is not require if you accessing direct element

-js can refer by using "css selector

syntax:
       document.querySelector("h2")-->//type selector

       document.querySelector("#pic)-->id selector

       document.querySelector(".pic)-->class selector
