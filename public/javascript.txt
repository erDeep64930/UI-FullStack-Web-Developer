                JavaScript

-js is light weight  JIT[just in time] compile program language.

Q.What is JIT?
  -there are two type of compiling technique:
  a) JIT [just in time]
  b) AOT [Ahead of time]

  --JIT compile logic in browser
  --AOT compile logic in app level

Js support various programming technique and approach:-

a) Functional programming
b) Structure programming
c) Imperative programming
d) Object Oriented programming

Js is not an OOP language , it support only few features of oops

Js is used in -
               client side =html
               server side =node.js
               database =mongoDb
               animation =Flash /CAD -[buildimg map civil branch]


evolution

1st browser "mosaic"
  GML,SGML = Presentation
  ECMA = Client side

 1990: Tim Berner Lee introduced html
  1994 :netscape communication - develop browser 


javascript with html [client side]

js is used client side in order to reduce the burden on server 
 via handling validation + Handling interaction + DOM manipulation[CRUD]

Q.What is the role of Js?
 -DOM manipulation

 integrated js into page :-
 Inline
 embedded
 external

 inline 
 eg:-
 <button oncick="window.print()>Print</button>

 embedded
 eg:-
 <script type="text/javascript">
 function printPage(){
   window.print()
 }
 </script>


 How Js refer HTML elements ?
-via DOM hierarchy[this is good not not used now-a-days becuase whenever the dom elements position are change then its dom upadte are needed to update .it is fast but not prefer]

you can refer by using "ID"
  document.getElementById()

id had conflict with css reference
id is not require if you accessing direct element

-js can refer by using "css selector

syntax:
       document.querySelector("h2")-->//type selector

       document.querySelector("#pic)-->id selector

       document.querySelector(".pic)-->class selector



Js Output technique

-alert()
-confirm()
-console.log() ,warn(),success() ,error(), debug(),info() etc..
-innerHTML
-innerText
-outerHTML
-document.write()


#JavaScript Input techniques:

-prompt()
-form input elements

prompt():-
   -it is like alert with input.

   prompt("your message","default value);

   prompt return 
       null - on cancel
       ""[empty]

 #every form element have reference id  
     <input type="text" id="txtName">
     <select id="lstCities">
     <input type="checkbox" id="optStock">

you can access elemnet and use its properties:

document.getElementById("txtName").value;
document.getElementById("lstCities").value;
document.getElementById("optStock").checked;

Q. what is the strict mode of JavaScript?
-strict mode for js allow to reduce code in-consistency 
-so that developer has to follow the coding standard 

<script>
"use strict"
x=10; //invalid -x is not define
document.write("x=" + x);
</script>


Q.how to write the JavaScript for legacy browser?[old version]

- by enclosing the code in html comment

Q. how to js comment 
// single line comment 
/* */ multi line comment
/// xml comment


--------l-52 start here----------

JavaScript language basic:-
 
Variable:-
-variable are storage location in memory where you can store a valueand use it as a part of expression
-



var x;
document.write("x=" + x);

Q.can a const change its value ?
- dynamically yes .


Global scope for variable :
-you can declare a variable in the module scope


#variable in javascript can be declare by using :-

a.) var 
b.) let 
c.) const

var :-
-it define a scope variable
-you can declare in any block of a function and access from any another block in function .
-var allow declaring, initialization,assigning
-var allow shadowing 
-var allow hoisting 

Q. what is shadowing ?
 - it is the process of re declaring same  name identifier within the scope .

 Q.) what is hoisting
  - it is a compiling technique ,where compiler can find declarations of variable before using it . hence you can use a variable before declaring .
eg:-

<script>
"use strict";
function f1(){
  x=10;
  document.write("x="+x);
  var x;
  }
  f1();
</script>


#let

-it is used to define block scope variable.
it is accessible only in block where it is declared or to its inner blocks .
-it allow declaring,assigning,initialize
-it will not allow shadowing and hoisting in "let"

 
const 
-it is used to define the block scope variable.
-it will allow only initialization
-no declaration
-no assigning
-no hoisting

Q.why we need a const ?
-const is require to initialize memory at the time of loading application or component 
-memory is initialize with some default value .
-if initialization is missing then by default value will be "undefined"

Q. cam we declare a global variable inside a function ?
 - yes , by browser window function

 function f1(){
  window.y = 20;
 }
function f2(){
  document.write("y=20" + y);
}
eg:-


#Variable Naming :-

   - Variable Name must starts with alhpabet or underscore.
  -variable name cannot exceed more than 255 charecter.
  -dont use language keyword for variable name 
  -always variable must speak what it is.

  eg:-
  var employee = new Employee();
  var product = new Product();
  var temporaryEmployee = new TemporaryEmployee();

      Data Types:-

  - it define the data structure .
  - data type determine the size and type of data.
  - data type are classified into 2 types:-

    - 1.) Primitive data type
    - 2.) Non Primitive Data type

Primitive data type:-

 - primitive data type are immutable types .
 - their structure will not change .
 - they fixed range for value .
 - value range can't change .
 - they use memory stack .
 - stack use "LIFO" [LAST IN FIRST OUT].
 -JS is primitive type :-

       a). Number
       b). String
       c). Boolean
       d). Null 
       e). undefined

  JavaScript is not a strongly typed . it is implicitly typed.

 var x= 10 ; // x is number 
 x = "john" // x is string.

  js number type refer to -
   -signed integer  [ -number]
   -Unsigned integer [+number]
   -floating point [24.56]
   -double [334.56 ,567.876]
   -decimal [29 decimal point]
   -exponent
   -binary
   -octa
   -hexa

js uses "isNan()" method to verify the number .

js cant identify a numeric value in string format . you have to explicitly convert into number by using following method 

 a).parseInt()
 b).parseFloat()


NOTE:-

# whatever input you get in html via form is string type so you need to convert it into other type .


var a ="10ab";
var b = 20;
var c = parseInt(a)+b;
 
 a= "ab20 // invalid
 a = "10ag23" //10 valid 

 10 +true = 11 //only in js 

 #String type :-

 string is a literal with group of characters enclosed in -

   a).single quote ['']
   b).double quote [""]
   c).back tick [``]

-single and double quote are used to configure inner and outer string combination

var link = "<a href='home.html'></a>"
